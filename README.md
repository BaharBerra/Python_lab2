# Military Equipment Losses Analysis (Ukraine-Russia War 2022-2024)

This project analyzes military equipment losses, specifically focusing on aircraft losses during the Ukraine-Russia war from 2022 to 2024. The analysis is performed using **Python**, leveraging powerful libraries like `NumPy`, `Pandas`, and `Matplotlib` to process, analyze, and visualize the data.

## Introduction
This project aims to explore and visualize the losses of military aircraft during the ongoing Ukraine-Russia war. The tasks involve analyzing cumulative loss data, calculating daily losses, identifying key loss events, and visualizing trends over specific time periods, such as the first year of the war and the summer of 2024.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project (`russia_losses_equipment.csv`) contains cumulative loss data on military aircraft, including daily updates on how many aircraft have been shot down.
